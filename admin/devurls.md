description: Learn how to configure dev URL support for a Coder deployment.
---

Developer (dev) URLs allow users to access the ports of running applications
they develop within their workspace. Coder listens for the applications running
on the specified ports and provides a browser link that can be used to access
the application.

Before individual developers can set up dev URLs, an administrator must
configure and enable dev URL usage.

## Before you proceed

You must own a wildcard DNS record for your custom domain name to enable and use
dev URLs with Coder.

## Enabling the use of dev URLs

[Dev URLs](../workspaces/devurls.md) is an opt-in feature. To enable dev URLs in
your cluster, you'll need to modify your:

1. Helm chart
1. Wildcard DNS record

### Step 1: Modify the Helm chart

Set `coderd.devurlsHost` to a wildcard domain in your `values.yaml` file:

```yaml
coderd:
  devurlsHost: "*.my-custom-domain.io"
```

Run the `helm upgrade` command:

```console
helm upgrade coder coder/coder -n coder --version=<VERSION> --values values.yaml"
```

> Beginning with Coder version `1.26.0`, you can set a constant suffix for all
> dev URLs (e.g., `*-suffix.coder.io`). This feature helps organizations that
> may incur expenses and delays due to the need for multiple wildcard DNS
> records.

### Step 2: Modify the wildcard DNS record

The final step to enabling dev URLs is to update your wildcard DNS record. Get
the **LoadBalancer IP address** using `kubectl --namespace coder get svc` and
point your wildcard DNS record (e.g., \*.my-custom-domain.io) to the
**external-IP** value found in the `ingress-nginx` or the `coderd` lines.

## Step 3 (Optional): Add a TLS certificate

For secure (HTTPS) dev URLs, you can add (or generate) a TLS certificate for the
wildcard domain.

- See our
  [guide for creating a TLS certificate using LetsEncrypt](../guides/tls-certificates)
- To add a custom certificate, refer to our
  [Helm chart](https://github.com/coder/enterprise-helm)

## Setting dev URL access permissions

Once you've enabled dev URLs for users, you can set the **maximum access
level**. To do so, go to **Manage** > **Admin**. On the **Infrastructure** tab,
scroll down to **Dev URL Access Permissions**.

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Maximum access level</th>
    <th>Description</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>Public</th>
    <td>Accessible by anyone with access to the
    network your cluster is on</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>Authenticated</th>
    <td>Accessible by any authenticated Coder user</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>Organization</th>
    <td>Accessible by anyone in the user's organization</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>Private</th>
    <td>Accessible only by the user</td>
  </tr>
</table>

You can set the maximum access level, but developers may choose to restrict
access further.

For example, if you set the maximum access level as **Authenticated**, then all
dev URLs created for workspaces in your Coder deployment will be accessible to
any authenticated Coder user.

The developer, however, can choose to set a stricter permission level (e.g.,
allowing only those in their organization to use the dev URL). Developers cannot
choose a more permissive option.

## Authentication with apps requiring a single callback URL

If you're using GitHub credentials to sign in to an application, and your GitHub
OAuth app has the authorization callback URL set to `localhost`, you will need
to work around the fact that GitHub enforces a single callback URL (since each
workspace gets a unique dev URL).

To do so, you can either:

- Use SSH tunneling to tunnel the web app to individual developers' `localhost`
  instead of dev URLs (this is also an out-of-the-box feature included with VS
  Code Remote)
- Use this workaround for
  [multiple callback sub-URLs](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/35942009/github-oauth-multiple-authorization-callback-url/38194107#38194107)
